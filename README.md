# SdoAnalysisToolkit_DemoData
Extended Dataset used for SDO Analysis in the Paper.

This repository has been spun off from the mainline SDO Analysis Toolkit to reduce the download size of the code package. It is available if a larger practice data set is desired. 

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:** 

1. Clone for download the full SDO Analysis Toolkit from https://github.com/GiszterLab/SdoAnalysisToolkit

2. Clone this repo (~400 MB) to the local drive. NOTE: If you attempt to download this directory as a ZIP file, the downloaded files will be corrupted. You _must_ clone the data through Git. 

3. Place (merge) the contents of this repo, the directory '../demoData/' into the SDO Analyis Toolkit '../demoData/' directory.

4. When prompted for _xtData_ or _ppData_ within the demo, load these files instead of the truncated version available within the toolkit.
